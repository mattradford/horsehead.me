## How does it work?
When you send a valid request to this website, a random photo of [human(s) wearing an uncomfortable latex horse head mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_head_mask) is displayed.

The photos are cached on your end for 1 day, which is why you don't get a new one on every page load.

While some placeholder image websites dynamically create new images, this service is SVG-based. For this to work properly, all photos have been encoded to Base64.
